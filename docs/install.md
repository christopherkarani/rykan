# Install

## Recommended installers

macOS and Linux:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://rykanv.com/install | sh
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
$installer = Join-Path $env:TEMP "ryk-install.ps1"
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/christopherkarani/ryk/main/scripts/install.ps1 -OutFile $installer
& $installer -Version (irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/christopherkarani/ryk/main/VERSION).Trim()
```

Windows has no OS sandbox; see [Windows Notes](#windows-notes) and the
[compatibility matrix](compatibility.md).

npm, WinGet, and Scoop are not published — see
[`packaging/README.md`](../packaging/README.md).

## Homebrew (ready, tap not published yet)

The formula in [`packaging/homebrew/`](../packaging/homebrew/) is real and
release-ready, but the public tap (`christopherkarani/homebrew-ryk`) is **not
published yet**. `brew tap christopherkarani/ryk` will 404 until that repo
exists. Until then, use the curl installer above.

When the tap is published:

```sh
brew tap christopherkarani/ryk
brew install ryk
ryk doctor --fix    # wire host hooks; nothing is gated until you run this
ryk doctor
```

`brew upgrade ryk` replaces the binary only. Run `ryk doctor --fix` afterwards
to refresh managed host plugins. Unlike the curl installer, `brew install` does
**not** wire host hooks — Homebrew's post-install `HOME` is temporary.

## Build From Source

```sh
./scripts/zig version   # must print 0.16.0
./scripts/build-all.sh  # or: ./scripts/zig build
./zig-out/bin/ryk version --json
```

Use Zig `0.16.0` (see `.zigversion`; prefer `./scripts/zig`). The product CLI is Zig-only: shell evaluation runs in-process via `shell_engine` (no Rust toolchain or `ryk-daemon` companion). `./scripts/build-all.sh` and `./scripts/zig build` both produce `./zig-out/bin/ryk`.

## Release Artifacts

Release helpers build checksum-covered **ryk** archives into `dist/`:

```sh
RYK_POSTHOG_PROJECT_TOKEN="<release-project-token>" ./scripts/build-release.sh
(cd dist && shasum -a 256 -c checksums.txt)
```

The release token is embedded as a public project identifier, not a user credential. For local archive and layout checks where telemetry transport must remain disabled, set `RYK_TELEMETRY_BUILD_DISABLED=1` instead.

Windows archive smoke-test helper:

```powershell
$env:RYK_TELEMETRY_BUILD_DISABLED = "1"
.\scripts\build-release.ps1 -ArchiveOnly
.\scripts\install.ps1 -Version 1.2.9 -ArtifactDir .\dist -InstallDir "$env:USERPROFILE\bin"
```

`scripts/build-release.ps1` does not produce `release-manifest.json`. Use `scripts/build-release.sh` plus `scripts/verify-release.sh` for production release verification.

Do not use an install-only path without verification. Download the archive, verify `dist/checksums.txt`, inspect the install script if using it, then install.

## Manual Artifact Install

1. Download or build the archive for your OS and CPU.
2. Verify its SHA-256 digest against `dist/checksums.txt`.
3. Extract the archive, or run `scripts/install.sh` / `scripts/install.ps1` to install the binary and runtime assets together.
4. Open a new shell so `PATH` includes the install dir, then run `ryk claude` (or the host you use). The installer writes the profile `PATH` entry and runs `ryk doctor --fix --from-install` to configure protection.

### Updating

If you installed with Homebrew:

```sh
brew update && brew upgrade ryk
ryk doctor --fix    # refresh managed host plugins after the upgrade
```

If you installed via the curl installer (`~/.local/bin/ryk`):

```sh
ryk update          # confirm + upgrade to latest
ryk update --check  # report only
ryk update --yes    # non-interactive
```

`ryk update` reuses the official curl installer (checksums + atomic replace). Use `ryk update --force` only when you intentionally want to override the normal release check. After the binary is replaced, the installer runs `ryk doctor --fix --from-install`, which refreshes managed host plugins (for example OpenCode `ryk.ts`, Codex/Claude marketplace plugins, and ryk-owned Hermes trees) so stale plugin files are upgraded in place without a manual delete.

The installers print a step-based receipt (brand header, phases, optional one-line host hint). They honor `NO_COLOR` and `RYK_INSTALL_QUIET=1` (non-error silence) and run the canonical `doctor --fix --from-install` setup door.

Windows (`scripts/install.ps1`) is **checksum-only (unsigned)**: it verifies
SHA-256 against `checksums.txt` and does not consume `checksums.txt.minisig`.
It shares the other core contracts (binary + runtime install, structured
failures, quiet mode, optional host hint) with a smaller surface: it does not
manage `PATH` (use your profile / user PATH) and does not soft-warn on a missing
dashboard UI bundle.

## Verifying a release

Signing is not yet active. `keys/ryk-release-minisign.pub` ships the sentinel
`RYK_RELEASE_PUBKEY_UNPROVISIONED`. Until a real key is provisioned,
`scripts/install.sh` reports `not yet active for this release` and continues on
SHA-256 only. `scripts/install.ps1` is checksum-only (Windows unsigned).

After provisioning, every release will publish `checksums.txt` (SHA-256 for each
artifact) and `checksums.txt.minisig`, an Ed25519 signature over that file in
[minisign](https://jedisct1.github.io/minisign/) format. One signature over the
checksums authenticates every artifact. Manual verification:

```sh
V=X.Y.Z
B="https://github.com/christopherkarani/ryk/releases/download/v$V"
curl -fsSLO "$B/checksums.txt" -O "$B/checksums.txt.minisig"
minisign -V -p keys/ryk-release-minisign.pub -x checksums.txt.minisig -m checksums.txt
shasum -a 256 -c checksums.txt --ignore-missing
```

Once the key is provisioned, `scripts/install.sh` will refuse a release whose
signature is missing or does not verify. If neither `minisign` nor `rsign` is
installed it will stop with instructions rather than skipping the check; you can
explicitly accept checksum-only trust with `RYK_INSTALL_ALLOW_UNSIGNED=1`, which
prints a visible `SKIPPED` line. That fail-closed path is **not** current
shipping behavior.

What signing does and does not protect — in particular that `curl … | sh` still
trusts whoever served the script — is spelled out in
[`release-signing.md`](release-signing.md).

## Release channel

The working public path is the checksum-verified curl installer. Homebrew is
ready but the tap is not published yet — see
[Homebrew](#homebrew-ready-tap-not-published-yet). The curl installer:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://rykanv.com/install | sh
```

It downloads the matching GitHub Release archive, verifies `checksums.txt`,
and installs the CLI and runtime assets. The
installer runs `ryk doctor --fix --from-install`, which creates a coding
default policy under `$HOME/.ryk/policy.yaml` and seeds the runtime user
fallback at `~/.config/ryk/policy.yaml` (create-only; never overwrites). That
user path is what `ryk <agent>` loads when a project has no local
`.ryk/policy.yaml` — without it, uninited directories fell back to
`builtin:strict` and could block host launches. The `packaging/` directory
contains build and container inputs; it is not a user installation channel.

## macOS Notes

macOS builds provide process supervision, environment filtering, staged writes, PATH/shell shims, MCP stdio proxying, audit/replay, and network policy decisions. Proxy route forcing is available per session when the proxy backend and OS sandbox attach are both active; proxy startup alone is not route forcing. OS filesystem isolation for protected agent children is available through the run engine (`ryk <agent>`; advanced flag: `ryk run --os-sandbox auto|on|off`) using Seatbelt on product majors **14–26** (capability/version gate). **CI attach evidence** is **linux amd64 (Landlock)**; Seatbelt attach is local. Doctor capability probes are not a live session claim; session-attach is proven only after child apply-before-exec succeeds.

## Linux Notes

Linux builds use backend detection for namespace, seccomp, Landlock, cgroup, and process supervision capability. OS filesystem isolation for protected agent children is available through the run engine (`ryk <agent>`; advanced flag: `ryk run --os-sandbox auto|on|off`) using Landlock when the host supports **ABI ≥ 1** (kernel **5.13+**). **CI attach evidence** is currently **linux amd64**; other cells are local until freeze jobs exist. Doctor Landlock probes are capability evidence only and never alone authorize a session `active` claim. `--os-sandbox on` fails closed when attach cannot complete.

## Windows Notes

ryk is macOS/Linux-first. Windows sessions run at **wrapper/hook grade** with **no OS sandbox**. There is no Seatbelt, Landlock, AppContainer, or Windows Filtering Platform session-attach backend; `src/sandbox/windows.zig` reports `strong_sandbox` unavailable. Doctor cannot promote a Windows session to `OS-enforced`. MCP stdio is **proxy** grade.

Windows builds use `ryk.exe`, PowerShell scripts, path normalization, command wrappers, staged writes, and process cleanup support where implemented. Transparent filesystem enforcement is unavailable (ryk-mediated staging and protected-path matching still run). Transparent network enforcement and proxy-mediated HTTP are unavailable (no loopback proxy).

`scripts/install.ps1` is checksum-only (Windows unsigned): it verifies SHA-256
against `checksums.txt` and does not read `checksums.txt.minisig`.

See the [compatibility matrix](compatibility.md) and [Windows platform notes](platform-windows.md). WinGet and Scoop are not published; they stay deferred pending a Windows story ([packaging/README.md](../packaging/README.md)).
