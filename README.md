# ryk

**Local guardrails for coding agents.**

Run Claude Code, Codex, Pi, OpenCode, Hermes, OpenClaw, or Grok through one local binary. ryk checks commands, files, secrets, network, and MCP actions before they hit your machine — allow / ask / deny / observe — and keeps the evidence on disk.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/assets/ryk-deny-demo.gif" alt="ryk denying an OpenCode rm -rf / command" width="720">
</p>

<p align="center"><em>Agent tries <code>rm -rf /</code> (or <code>rm -rf ./build</code>). ryk denies the recursive force-delete. Session stays on your laptop.</em></p>

## Install

macOS and Linux:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://rykanv.com/install | sh
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
$installer = Join-Path $env:TEMP "ryk-install.ps1"
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/christopherkarani/ryk/main/scripts/install.ps1 -OutFile $installer
& $installer -Version (irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/christopherkarani/ryk/main/VERSION).Trim()
```

Latest is [v0.2.21](https://github.com/christopherkarani/ryk/releases/tag/v0.2.21). Pin with `RYK_VERSION=0.2.21`.

## Start an agent

```sh
ryk claude    # or: codex | pi | opencode | openclaw | hermes | grok
```

Scan past agent sessions for risky commands and secret-like exposure:

```sh
ryk scan
```

If ryk saves you a bad day, [star the repo](https://github.com/christopherkarani/ryk) — it helps other engineers find it.

## What you get

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Host integrations | Launch aliases for Pi, Hermes, OpenCode, Codex, Claude Code, OpenClaw, and Grok. Cursor is supported through host discovery and its shell hook. |
| OS sandboxing | Automatic OS filesystem sandboxing with Seatbelt on macOS and Landlock on Linux when available. Windows has no OS sandbox (wrapper/hook grade only). |
| Secret redaction | Secret-like values are redacted before audit and replay data is written. |
| MCP protection | MCP tool calls are classified locally, and supported stdio servers run through ryk's protected proxy. |
| 86 safety packs | Built-in command patterns for destructive and sensitive operations, with project-level opt-in packs. |
| Policy decisions | `allow`, `ask`, `deny`, and `observe` decisions for local actions. |
| Local evidence | A localhost dashboard (including a Terminal view of blocked commands) and replay commands for sessions, decisions, and audit records. |
| One local binary | The Zig CLI owns launch, evaluation, policy checks, host adapters, and diagnostics. |



### Supported hosts

| Host | Entry point | Integration point |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Pi | `ryk pi` | Bundled extension |
| Hermes | `ryk hermes` | `pre_tool_call` |
| OpenCode | `ryk opencode` | `tool.execute.before` |
| Codex | `ryk codex` | `PreToolUse` |
| Claude Code | `ryk claude` | `PreToolUse` |
| OpenClaw | `ryk openclaw` | `tool.before` |
| Grok | `ryk grok` | `PreToolUse` |
| Cursor | Host discovery and `cursor-agent` preset | `beforeShellExecution` |



## How policy works

ryk evaluates each guarded action locally. The main policy surfaces are:

| Surface | Examples |
| --- | --- |
| Commands | Shell commands, pipelines, redirects, and interpreters |
| Files | Workspace files, project control files, and sensitive paths |
| Environment | Inherited variables and secret access |
| Network | Host allowlists and mediated outbound connections |
| Tools | MCP and host tool calls mapped to effects |

The policy mode controls the response:

| Mode | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `observe` | Record decisions without blocking supported actions |
| `ask` | Prompt for risky actions when the host can resume them |
| `strict` | Deny unknown or risky actions unless a rule allows them |
| `ci` | Run strict behavior without prompts; `ask` becomes deny |

Explicit deny rules take priority. Safety packs classify commands and effects, but they do not grant permission past a deny rule.

Validate a built-in preset:

```sh
ryk policy check --preset ask
```

See the [policy reference](docs/policy.md) for policy files, priorities, and examples.

## Safety packs

Safety packs extend the shell evaluator with focused command coverage. Baseline packs such as `core.*` and `system.disk` are enabled by default.

```sh
ryk packs
ryk packs show core.git
ryk packs enable containers.docker database.postgresql
ryk packs disable containers.docker
```

In a Git workspace, project pack choices are stored in `.ryk.toml`. Use `ryk packs` for scripts and diagnostics.

Test or explain a command without running it:

```sh
ryk test "git status"
ryk test "rm -rf /" --format json
ryk explain "rm -rf /"
```

## Architecture

The launch aliases, host adapters, shell evaluator, and policy engine share one local decision path.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/ryk-architecture.svg" alt="ryk architecture from agent hosts through local policy to guarded effects and evidence" width="100%">
</p>

1. A launch alias starts the agent with ryk's session defaults.
2. Host adapters send shell and tool events to the evaluator.
3. The evaluator combines policy rules, safety-pack matches, and the active mode.
4. ryk allows, asks, observes, or denies the action.
5. The session records local evidence for the dashboard and replay commands.

## Dashboard

Start the localhost dashboard:

```sh
ryk dashboard
```

Open [http://127.0.0.1:7742](http://127.0.0.1:7742). The server is localhost-only by default and uses the existing ryk policy and CLI paths.

For smoke tests and automation, `--once` serves one request and then exits:

```sh
ryk dashboard --once
```

## Limits

ryk is graded mediation, not a universal OS sandbox. It is macOS/Linux-first. Windows sessions run at wrapper/hook grade with no OS sandbox. Absolute-path binaries, non-shimmed tools, non-proxy traffic, and host hooks that do not fire can sit outside a particular enforcement surface. `ryk doctor` reports platform capability; it does not prove that a child session attached to an OS sandbox, and it cannot promote Windows to `OS-enforced`. Read the [compatibility matrix](docs/compatibility.md) and [threat model](docs/threat-model.md) before making a stronger claim.

Release builds include opt-in product telemetry: nothing is collected or sent unless you run `ryk telemetry enable`. See [docs/telemetry.md](docs/telemetry.md) for the exact payload contract.
